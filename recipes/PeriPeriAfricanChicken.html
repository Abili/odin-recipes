    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a great spicy marinade recipe for a traditional African grilled 
        chicken dish. "Great for BBQ," says UKNO1CHEF. "Nice with salad and 
        fries, but I like adding it to a pita with salad and garlic Greek yogurt 
        (3/4 cup Greek yogurt and 3 cloves of crushed garlic with finely chopped 
        chives)."
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh lemon juice</li>

        <li>¼ cup paprika</li>
            
        <li>2 tablespoons hot chili powder</li>
            
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh ginger</li>
            
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            
        <li>4 bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together lemon juice, paprika, chili powder, garlic,
             ginger, and salt in a large bowl until well combined.
              Add chicken; rub until well coated and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.
        </li>

        <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grates.</li>
            
        <li>Place chicken onto the preheated grill; discard marinade. 
            Cook, turning occasionally, until skins are slightly charred 
            and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
             inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 
             165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
